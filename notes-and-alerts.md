```html
<an-alert role="alert">
  <strong>

  </strong>
</an-alert>
```

```html
<a-note role="note">

</a-note>
```

These are custom elements because otherwise they'd just be `<div>`s.

`<strong>` is specced to act as an alert, sort of, but the distinction is largely academic and and it gets abused as "more semantic" bolding 99% of the time. Software doesn't treat it differently.
